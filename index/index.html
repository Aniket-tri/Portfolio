          I am a passionate beginner web developer who loves creating simple, clean, and user-friendly websites. I am currently learning and working with HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript, and I enjoy turning ideas into real web pages.

I focus on building websites that are easy to navigate, responsive, and visually appealing. As a new developer, I am always eager to learn new skills, improve my coding knowledge, and take on new challenges.

I believe in continuous learning and aim to grow as a developer by creating meaningful and practical web projects.
As a new developer, I bring curiosity, dedication, and a strong learning mindset to every project. I am constantly improving my skills by practicing, building real projects, and exploring modern web trends. I see challenges as opportunities to grow and refine my abilities.
